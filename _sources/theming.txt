Theming
=======

We don't do any real theming during the training. We'll just explain the options you have.

* Diazo (plone.app.theming): This is the modern way to go and `default theme in Plone 5 <https://github.com/plone/plonetheme.barceloneta/>`_ will be a diazo-theme!
* You can use (and adapt) one of many publicly available Diazo-themes: https://pypi.python.org/pypi?%3Aaction=search&term=plonetheme&submit=search (try `plonetheme.onegov <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/plonetheme.onegov>`_ for example)
* Creating a custom theme
* A starting-point can be the built-in Diazo Theme editor
* Old-school Theming (extending the built-in default-theme)
* Deliverance

If you seek a training about Diazo we recommend a training by `Chrissy Wainwright <https://twitter.com/cdw9>`_ or `Maik DerStappen <http://www.derstappen-it.de/>`_
