Welcome to Mastering Plone's documentation!
===========================================

This is the documentation for the "Mastering Plone"-training by Philip Bauer and Patrick Gerken of `starzel.de <http://www.starzel.de>`_.

The training is intended as a three-day course for people who are new to Plone. It can be abridged to two days.

If you have question, found errors or want to book us for a training please contact us at team@starzel.de.

Please note that this document is not aimed at the larger public. It is the documentation that people get who attend a training. Even though we attempt to include the most important parts of what we teach in this documentation it can not be considered complete without the spoken word.

A more complete documentation can be found at http://developer.plone.org/index.html.
